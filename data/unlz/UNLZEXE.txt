UnLZEXE:

    This tool was designed to decompress all .EXE files created by
    Fabrice Bellard's popular LZEXE v0.90 & v0.91.

    The key reason to decompress files is so they can be run and examined
    by debuggers like DEBUG, CodeView or Periscope. If the file is not
    decompressed the user must step through the decompression and relocation
    code every time the file is loaded before breakpoints can be set.

    Disassemblers like the very powerful V Communications' "Sourcer! The
    Commenting Disassembler!" need the file to be decompressed so that it
    can make sense of the code and provide labeling of jumps and calls.

    The usage of UnLZEXE is very simple, the program is run with the name
    of the file to be decompressed and a name of the file to place the
    decompressed image in. The decompression process will be aborted if
    the source file is not compressed with LZEXE, or a supported version
    thereof. The process will also be aborted if there is insufficient
    memory for UnLZEXE to allocated its buffers, this is a programming
    issue and frankly I'm too lazy to expend the effort to rewrite the
    code to overcome this. If this is really an issue for you I can
    supply a DOS Extender or Win32 version.

    If you found this tool to be mildly useful or entertaining please send
    me some Email, positive feedback is always good to get and makes writing
    FREEWARE worth while. If you didn't like this tool, discard it, and keep
    your sentiments to yourself.

I have finished writing Windows Source Version 3, which is now available
from V Communications Inc. Versions one & two of Windows Source were
written by Andrew Schulman.

What is Windows Source?

Windows Source is an add-on to V Communications' Sourcer disassembler
which preprocesses executable, dynamic link library, device drivers and
VxD files for Windows 3.x, Windows '95 & Windows NT. It also provides
support for OS/2 1.x, 2.x & Warp.

Where possible symbolic debug information included in separate .SYM,
.DBG files, or included in Codeview or COFF debugging sections.
